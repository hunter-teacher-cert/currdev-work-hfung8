# JavaScript/Web Development Course 

I think that a new course in JavaScript and Web Development would be good for the school that I am currently teaching at. AP CS Principles and AP CS A are both taught at the school, so a new course introducing JavaScript would be interesting for students who wish to go into web development. 

## Description 
The JavaScript/Web Development course will allow students who have not previously worked with JavaScript to be introduced to such topics as: 
1) Learning how to use the inspect functionality on the Google Chrome Browser. 
2) Basic CSS
3) Basic HTML
4) Project Portfolio which could include making a polished website with a CSS Framework such as Bootstrap. 
One advanced topic that would challenge students would be to be able to make an API call to an online website that has a database. This challenge would still be relevant to the course, seeing that it is about developing a skill for creating a website.

## Target Audience 
The course would be targetting Grades 10, 11 and 12. It will not follow an AP curriculum since there is not an AP JavaScript/Web Development course. If students are advanced enough in Grade 12, React JS could be introduced. 

## Where it fits along with other courses taught at the school 
JavaScript is a High-Level Language that is important for browsers to render websites. It is a different language than Python, Scratch and Java which are all taught at my school. The basics of JavaScript are similar to Python and Java although CSS and HTML would be different languages that are still useful for making websites. The course could be run from Grade 10 through 12, with more difficult content coming at the older grades. Mastery based learning along with Habits for Success are two learning techniques that are employed at the school that I am at. Creating a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with making an API call would be an example of a summative assessment. Mastering API calls could be a Mastery learning objective.
