The current course that I am teaching is AP CS Principles. The two pre-packaged courses that I will compare are from Project Stem and Code HS. (projectstem.org and codehs.com). 

## Major Differences 

Project Stem has the AP Course split up into different sections with Python being taught at the very end of the course. 
Code HS starts in Python because it is AP CS Principles taught in Python. The very end discusses the idea of computing, data, the internet and digital information. 
Code HS has handouts that can be given to the students. Project Stem does not. 
Code HS allows the teacher to add to the curriculum which could be useful later on once you have established a routine with the students. 

## Major Similarities 

They are both quite similar in that both teach with the units with videos and assessments at the end. 
They both cover Digital information, The internet, ideas of computing and big data. 

## Comparative Strengths and weaknesses
Code HS is much more customizable, teachers can add assignments to the course that they are enrolled in. Handouts are also available. The User Interface for Project Stem is much cleaner and easier to read. Students would most likely enjoy learning from Project Stem more as a result of this. 

## Would you adopt anything from them for your own curriculum? Why or why not?
Although the coding is not very heavy in principles, I would adopt the content on the idea of computing from Project Stem. They have good explanations on the iterative development process, algorithms and defining what algorithms are repeatable. IE: sequencing(using steps in a code block), iteration(using for loop and while loop) and selection(using if conditionals). These are important steps for any coder to know and understand.
