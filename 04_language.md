# Grade 12: Introduction to Processing 
## Open for students who are taking AP CS A 

Language: Processing

How does one write code in this language? 
They write code in a text editor which includes a compiler and a window. Processing is written in java and it includes: functions, function definition, if conditionals and variables. There are two versions of Processing that can be used to draw. They are called "static" and "active" sketches, with static sketches being used by people new to programming. Active sketches have a setup() function as well as a draw() function which keeps running code in a loop.

How does one run code in this language?
Code is run by clicking the run button. It is compiled as well and a new window is opened for display. 

Rate the complexity of the syntax? 
On a scale of 1 - 10 for complexity, the difficulty would be around a 7. It would depend on the experience of the programmer. They would need to be familiar with Java. 

Strengths:
- It is written in Java and takes similar code pieces from that language.
- Drawings can be animated as well by writing code in the draw function(). 
- There is copy and paste ability and a find ability for easier access to the code that you want. 
- There is a window display, where you can see the drawing. 
- You can create 3 dimensional drawings.
- The langauge can be used to create Art.
- Very little code can be written to draw 3 dimensional pieces of art. 

How would you utilize the strengths in the class? 
For students who are familiar with Java and can understand how to use the IDE, Processing could be an excellent tool for them to use on top of learning how to code. Art would have to be a strength of the students as well as graphical design. Since little code is written to create certain animations, students would be able to pick it up quickly if they understand the Processing language. 

Weaknesses:
- If you aren't familiar with Java it might be difficult to understand. 
- May be too advanced for certain programmers. 
- Kind of difficult to use in a classroom setting for k-12 because it may be too advanced. 

How would you mitigate the weaknesses? 
This class should be available to students who want to learn how code can be used for making artistic designs. There is a lot of content and a lot of different pieces can be created with Processing. I wouldn't discourage students who don't have particularly strong coding skills from taking the class, as they could see how what they learn applies to programming in general, however I wouldn't recommend student how don't have a background in Java from taking the class. To make general pieces of art, there are no big topics that are too advanced for students to understand. 

Why would you select this language for this class? 
The Processing language seems very powerful, there is a lot of documentation and the level of understanding to create a piece of art doesn't seem so far fetched, if the student understands Java. It would be a great way to get into graphical design with coding, which could be an exciting new topic for students to try to learn. Some might be interested in learning how to use code to make art.
