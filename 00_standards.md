Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, explain how.

9-12.CT.8
Develop a program that
effectively uses control
structures in order to
create a computer program
for practical intent,
personal expression, or to
address a societal issue.

An example assignment would be to create an app using JavaScript that helps people find the nearest soup kitchen or thrift store, based upon their location. This assignment would help students to build something from scratch using techniques such as understanding how to make an API call to Google Places API for example. Students can learn how to effectively create a positive result on their community through a hackathon style competition. The students with the best application would win the hackathon. This addresses the societal issue and also the creation of a computer program. 

9-12.DL.7
Design and implement
strategies that support
safety and security of
digital information,
personal identity,
property, and physical
and mental health when
operating in the digital
world.

An example assignment would be to create a mental health app to increase awareness of mental health issues. The students can graph the way that they feel using three.js and also use other types of JavaScript frameworks to graph their feelings based upon a scale of feeling not so great to feeling great. There could be questions that are used to differentiate each graphing point and to help us to determine where the student stands on the scale.
